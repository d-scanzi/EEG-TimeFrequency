# EEG-TimeFrequency
Time Frequency analysis of EEG data

## DISCLOSURE
This repository contains scripts in OCTAVE about time-frequency analysis of EEG data. These scripts are the result of the course [Complete neural signal processing and analysis: Zero to hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/solved-challenges-ants/) that I am currently following. This course was created by [Dr. Mike X Cohen](http://www.mikexcohen.com/#courses), which agreed in the creation of this repository. 

The scripts found here are created by me on the basis of exercises and material presented in the course. The original scripts, as well as the datasets utilised, will not be share. 

## CONTENT
The content of this material is varied, hoewever it is focused on time and frequency analysis of EEG data. The first scripts will aim at simulating neuronal activity and their goals are: (1) to understand the bases of electrical-brain activity, (2) to lay the fundatamental concepts for more complex time-frequency analysis and (3) to acquaint me with [EEGLAB](https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/56415-eeglab) data structures and common operations. 

After these, there will be scripts focusing on the time-domain analysis (ERPs) and the frequency-domain analysis(Fourier Transformation).

***(The content will be updated with the progression through the course)***
